Reflection
This is a project I began writting in the week after IT for Grade 12 started. I started on Nov 24th, 2020, and finished the game on Dec 07, 2020. 
I spent around 40-45 hours during the two weeks outside of school. I have been ahead of the rest of the class and finished all the lessons within
the first week. So I challenged myself to write a chess game.
When I began the project I only had basic knowledge about java, and I had to learn a lot of things along the way.
For example, I did not know how to import and image, what kind of types of images there are, or how to use JFrame to present the game.
I was not really familiar with working with classes and objects, and I had no idea how to learn a new library.
I did not really care and I began writing. Sometimes I would get stuck for a few days on problems such as how exactly I should present
the squares on the frame, or linking the logics to the visuals of the game. Now as I look back, I would have done many things differently
and more efficiently. It was not an easy process for a beginner to attempt a chanllenge like this, but as I put in more hours I became
familiar with using arrays, calling different methods, and using loops.
The game does not have any rules yet. For almost an entire week I have been stuck on the most chanllenging methods yet - check and checkmate.
With these two methods the code become really complicated, as I am using nested for loops and recursive functions. I am in the process of
debugging the methods, and I expect it to take me another few weeks before I can finish debugging these two methods.
Thank you for trying my first game.
